### 🔢 JavaScript Operators – Cheat Sheet

| **Category**              | **Example**               | **Description**                                               |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Arithmetic**            | `5 + 3` → `8`             | Performs math operations like addition, subtraction, etc.     |
| **Comparison**            | `5 > 3` → `true`          | Compares two values and returns a Boolean (`true` / `false`)  |
| **Logical**               | `true && false` → `false` | Combines Booleans using AND (`&&`), OR (`WIP`), and NOT (`!`) |
| **Assignment**            | `let x = 5`               | Assigns a value to a variable                                 |
| **Ternary / Conditional** | `(5 > 3) ? 'Yes' : 'No'`  | Shorthand for `if...else`, returns value based on condition   |

# ✏️ Basic Math Operations in JavaScript

Arithmetic operators let you perform fundamental math operations. These are familiar from school—just implemented in code.

## ✅ Supported Arithmetic Operators

| Operator | Description            | Example          | Output |
| -------- | ---------------------- | ---------------- | ------ |
| `+`      | Addition               | `10 + 5`         | `15`   |
| `-`      | Subtraction            | `20 - 7`         | `13`   |
| `*`      | Multiplication         | `6 * 4`          | `24`   |
| `/`      | Division               | `15 / 3`         | `5`    |
| `%`      | Modulus (Remainder)    | `17 % 5`         | `2`    |
| `**`     | Exponentiation (Power) | `3 ** 3`         | `27`   |
| `++`     | Increment (by 1)       | `let x = 5; x++` | `6`    |
| `--`     | Decrement (by 1)       | `let y = 8; y--` | `7`    |

---

## **🧪 Arithmetic Operators in Action**

```js
// Addition (+): Adds two numbers
const sum = 10 + 5;
console.log("Addition: 10 + 5 =", sum); // Output: 15

// Subtraction (-): Subtracts right operand from left
const difference = 20 - 7;
console.log("Subtraction: 20 - 7 =", difference); // Output: 13

// Multiplication (*): Multiplies two numbers
const product = 6 * 4;
console.log("Multiplication: 6 * 4 =", product); // Output: 24

// Division (/): Divides left operand by right
const quotient = 15 / 3;
console.log("Division: 15 / 3 =", quotient); // Output: 5

// Modulus (%): Gives remainder of division
const remainder = 17 % 5;
console.log("Modulus: 17 % 5 =", remainder); // Output: 2

// Exponentiation (**): Raises first operand to the power of second
const power = 3 ** 3;
console.log("Exponentiation: 3 ** 3 =", power); // Output: 27

// Increment (++): Increases value by 1
let incrementValue = 5;
incrementValue++; // Same as: incrementValue = incrementValue + 1
console.log("Increment: 5++ =", incrementValue); // Output: 6

// Decrement (--): Decreases value by 1
let decrementValue = 8;
decrementValue--; // Same as: decrementValue = decrementValue - 1
console.log("Decrement: 8-- =", decrementValue); // Output: 7
```

## 💡 Tips for Using Arithmetic Operators

- Use `++` and `--` carefully—especially **pre vs post** increment in loops or conditions (`++i` vs `i++`).
- Modulus `%` is great for checking **even/odd** numbers: `x % 2 === 0` means even.
- Exponentiation `**` is available from ES2016+. Use `Math.pow()` if you need backward compatibility.

## **🚀 Comparison Operators and Equality**

Comparison operators are a core part of any programming language — and in JavaScript, they're not just about checking values, but also types. This lesson breaks down how comparisons work, especially the key difference between **loose (`==`)** and **strict (`===`)** equality.

> 📌 **Goal**: Learn how to compare values correctly in JavaScript, avoid type coercion bugs, and use best practices for equality checks.

---

## 🧰 Setup

We’ll use three variables to explore the behavior of different comparison operators:

```js
const x = 10; // A number
const y = 5; // Another number
const z = "10"; // A string with the same content as x, but different type
```

---

## 🔧 Usage – Comparison Operators in Action

```js
// 👉 Is x greater than y?
console.log("Is x > y? ", x > y);
// true — 10 is greater than 5

// 👉 Is x greater than or equal to y?
console.log("Is x >= y? ", x >= y);
// true — x equals 10, which is greater than 5

// 👉 Is y less than x?
console.log("Is y < x? ", y < x);
// true — 5 is less than 10

// 👉 Is y less than or equal to x?
console.log("Is y <= x? ", y <= x);
// true — again, 5 < 10
```

> ✅ These operators (`>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`) are straightforward — they compare numeric values and return a **boolean** (`true` or `false`).

---

## **⚖️ Equality in JavaScript: Strict vs. Loose**

JavaScript has **two types of equality**, and they behave very differently:

### 1. Loose Equality (`==`)

```js
// 👉 Is x loosely equal to z?
console.log("Is x == z? ", x == z);
// true — '10' (string) is converted to 10 (number) before comparing
```

> ⚠️ Loose equality performs **type coercion**. It converts values to a common type before comparing, which can cause bugs if you're not careful.

---

### 2. Strict Equality (`===`)

```js
// 👉 Is x strictly equal to z?
console.log("Is x === z? ", x === z);
// false — types are different (number vs. string), so it's not equal
```

> ✅ Strict equality **does not perform type coercion**. It checks both value and type. This is the recommended approach in most real-world code.

---

## ❗ Inequality Operators

Just like equality, inequality checks also come in **loose** and **strict** flavors.

```js
// 👉 Loose inequality (ignores type)
console.log("Is x != z? ", x != z);
// false — '10' == 10 is true, so != is false

// 👉 Strict inequality (checks type + value)
console.log("Is x !== z? ", x !== z);
// true — different types, so they are not strictly equal
```

> ✅ Use `!==` instead of `!=` to avoid unexpected behavior from type coercion.

---

## 💡 Tips for Beginners

- Always prefer `===` and `!==` unless you have a **very specific** reason to allow type coercion.
- When in doubt, **check the type first** using `typeof` to avoid surprise comparisons.
- Keep your comparisons **predictable and explicit** — that’s what makes code clean and bug-resistant.

---

## 📦 Real-World Analogy

Think of `==` as a lenient friend who says "close enough!" — and `===` as a strict teacher who says "not the same unless everything matches."

```js
// Type mismatch but value looks the same
console.log(0 == false); // true 😬 (loose comparison)
console.log(0 === false); // false ✅ (strict comparison)
```

---

## ✅ Summary

| Operator | Description       | Type Sensitive? | Recommended |
| -------- | ----------------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| `==`     | Loose equality    | ❌ No           | 🚫 Avoid    |
| `!=`     | Loose inequality  | ❌ No           | 🚫 Avoid    |
| `===`    | Strict equality   | ✅ Yes          | ✅ Yes      |
| `!==`    | Strict inequality | ✅ Yes          | ✅ Yes      |

Understanding equality and comparison operators is essential for writing clean, bug-free JavaScript. Stick with `===` and `!==`, and always be aware of type coercion when using `==` or `!=`.

## Equality Comparison Cheatsheet (Comparing equality methods)

Comparing values in JavaScript can be tricky.  
Different comparison methods behave differently — especially when it comes to _type coercion_, _special cases_ like `NaN` and `0/-0`, and _object identity_.

This guide breaks it down clearly:

| `x`                 | `y`                 | `==` (Loose Equality) | `===` (Strict Equality) | `Object.is(x, y)` (SameValue) | SameValueZero (e.g., `Map`, `Set`) |

## 🎯 Concept: Why So Many Comparison Types?

In JavaScript, equality isn't just about the **values** — it's also about **types**, **identity**, and **edge cases**.  
Choosing the right method depends on whether you want:

- **Type coercion** (`==`)
- **Strict type & value match** (`===`)
- **Precise value identity** (`Object.is`)
- **Zero-handling consistency** (`SameValueZero`, e.g., in `Set`, `Map`, `findIndex`)

## ⚙️ Setup: Understand Each One Quickly

| Method        | Quick Description | Key Points                                                                                |
| :------------ | :---------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `==`          | Loose Equality    | Converts types if needed (type coercion).                                                 |
| `===`         | Strict Equality   | No type coercion. Both type and value must match.                                         |
| `Object.is`   | SameValue         | Like `===`, but **handles `NaN` correctly** and **distinguishes `+0` and `-0`**.          |
| SameValueZero | Special Handling  | Like `Object.is`, **but treats `+0` and `-0` as the same**. Used internally by Maps/Sets. |

## 🧠 Understanding Strict vs Loose Equality in JavaScript

When you're writing JavaScript, understanding the difference between **strict (`===`)** and **loose (`==`)** equality is crucial for building **reliable, bug-free** applications.

This concept might sound simple at first, but it hides some tricky behavior that can _easily_ trip you up in real-world codebases.

Let's break it down properly. 🚀

---

## 📦 Setup: What is Equality in JavaScript?

In JavaScript, two values are considered equal when they **represent the same value**.

Example with **strict equality**:

```javascript
// Comparing identical strings
console.log("This is a string." === "This is a string."); // true

// Comparing identical numbers
console.log(2 === 2); // true
```

Here, we used the **strict equality operator `===`**, which checks **both the value and the type**.

---

## ⚖️ Loose Equality (`==`) — The "Evil Twin"

JavaScript also supports something called **loose equality**, written with `==`.

It allows values of **different types** to be considered equal after **type coercion**.

Example:

```javascript
// Comparing number and string with loose equality
console.log(5 == "5"); // true
```

**Why?**  
JavaScript tries to be "helpful" by converting the string `"5"` into a number `5` before comparing.  
_Helpful?_ Maybe.  
_Predictable?_ Not at all. 🙃

---

## 🛡️ Strict Equality (`===`) — The Safer Choice

Strict equality **does not perform type coercion**.  
It **only returns true** if the **types and the values are both identical**.

Example:

```javascript
// Number and string with strict equality
console.log(20 === "20"); // false
```

Even though `20` and `"20"` look similar, they are **different types** (`Number` vs `String`), so `===` correctly returns `false`.

✅ **Always prefer `===` for predictable, bug-free code.**

---

## 🧪 Real-World Behavior Examples

Let's dig into some common cases where loose equality (`==`) _betrays_ you:

```javascript
console.log("" == 0); // true 😨
console.log(0 == "0"); // true 😨
console.log(false == "false"); // false (surprising but correct)
console.log(false == 0); // true 😱
console.log(null == undefined); // true (weird but consistent)
```

Using **strict equality (`===`)**, the behavior becomes predictable:

```javascript
console.log("" === 0); // false
console.log(0 === "0"); // false
console.log(false === "false"); // false
console.log(false === 0); // false
console.log(null === undefined); // false
```

---

## **🧩 Objects and Arrays: Special Case!**

Important:  
**Objects and arrays are compared by _reference_, not by value**, even when they look identical.

```javascript
// Comparing two empty objects
console.log({} === {}); // false

// Comparing two empty arrays
console.log([] === []); // false
```

👉 Even though the content looks the same, **different memory references** mean they are **not equal**.

_(We'll explore this deeper in a later module called “Value vs Reference.” Stay tuned!)_

---

## 📝 Practical Tips

- **Always use `===` and `!==`** unless you have an exceptional reason not to.
- **Treat `==` and `!=` as code smells** — if you see them, question why they're there.
- **Be cautious comparing objects and arrays** — reference checks, not value checks.
- **Understand type coercion pitfalls** when maintaining legacy code that uses `==`.

## 🔥 Real-World Developer Wisdom

Quoting **Douglas Crockford**, author of _JavaScript: The Good Parts_:

> "JavaScript has two sets of equality operators: `===` and `!==`, and their evil twins `==` and `!=`.
> The good ones work the way you would expect.
> The evil twins attempt type coercion using complicated, unmemorable rules."

---

## 🧩 Visual Representation: Predictable vs Chaotic

Loose Equality (`==`):  
✅ Lots of surprising green boxes.  
😵‍💫 Unpredictable comparisons like `'' == 0` or `false == '0'`.

Strict Equality (`===`):  
✅ Clean, straight diagonal line.  
😎 Predictable — only identical type + value matches.

_(Imagine it like a messy vs clean matrix — strict is way easier to reason about.)_

---

## 🎯 Conclusion: The Moral of the Story

✅ **Always** use triple equals (`===`) unless you have an extremely good reason not to.  
✅ **Avoid** loose equality (`==`) like it’s technical debt.  
✅ **Predictability > Convenience** when building real-world systems.

## **🚀 Introduction to Logical Operators in JavaScript**

In this lesson, we're diving into **logical operators** — some of the most essential tools when building real-world JavaScript applications. Logical operators let us **combine multiple conditions** and control the flow of our programs more intelligently.

We'll cover:

- The syntax and basic behavior of logical operators
- How they interact with **truthy** and **falsy** values
- Practical examples
- Real-world tips for usage

> **Heads up:**  
> A full mastery of logical operators also depends on understanding `if/else` statements and what truthy/falsy mean. We’ll just focus on the syntax and behavior for now — and circle back later for advanced use cases.

---

## **🛠 Logical Operators Overview**

JavaScript provides **three** main logical operators:

| Operator | Name |                    Symbol                     | Behavior |
| :------: | :--- | :-------------------------------------------: | :------: | ---------------------------------------------------- |
|   AND    | `&&` | Returns `true` if **all** operands are truthy |
|    OR    | `    |                                               |    `     | Returns `true` if **at least one** operand is truthy |
|   NOT    | `!`  |   Reverses the boolean value of an operand    |

---

## Setup and Syntax

Let's walk through each logical operator, one by one.

---

## ✅ AND Operator (`&&`)

The `AND (&&)` operator checks **whether all conditions are truthy**.  
If even one condition is falsy, it immediately returns `false`.

```javascript
// **AND Operator (&&)**

// Case 1: true AND false → returns false
console.log(true && false); // false

// Case 2: true AND true → returns true
console.log(true && true); // true

// Case 3: false AND false → returns false
console.log(false && false); // false
```

> **Real-world Example:**  
> Checking if a user is logged in **AND** has verified their email before granting dashboard access.

```javascript
const isLoggedIn = true;
const isEmailVerified = false;

// Grant access only if both conditions are true
const canAccessDashboard = isLoggedIn && isEmailVerified;
console.log(canAccessDashboard); // false
```

### 🧠 Important Notes:

- You can **chain multiple** conditions with `&&`.
- As soon as one condition is falsy, JavaScript **short-circuits** (stops evaluating the rest).

```javascript
// Chaining multiple conditions
console.log(true && true && false); // false
```

> ⏳ **Optimization Tip:**  
> Using `&&` can improve performance because JavaScript short-circuits on the first falsy operand — **O(1)** early exit behavior.

---

## ✅ OR Operator (`||`)

The `OR (||)` operator checks **if at least one operand is truthy**.  
It returns `true` immediately upon finding the first truthy value.

```javascript
// **OR Operator (||)**

// Case 1: true OR false → returns true
console.log(true || false); // true

// Case 2: true OR true → returns true
console.log(true || true); // true

// Case 3: false OR false → returns false
console.log(false || false); // false
```

> **Real-world Example:**  
> Allowing login via **Google** **or** **Facebook**.

```javascript
const hasGoogleAccount = false;
const hasFacebookAccount = true;

// Allow login if the user has either account
const canLogin = hasGoogleAccount || hasFacebookAccount;
console.log(canLogin); // true
```

### 🧠 Important Notes:

- You can **chain multiple** conditions with `||`.
- As soon as one condition is truthy, JavaScript **short-circuits** (stops checking further).

```javascript
// Chaining multiple conditions
console.log(false || false || true); // true
```

> ⚡ **Optimization Tip:**  
> Use `||` to provide **default fallback values** — a common pattern in JavaScript apps.

```javascript
const username = userInput || "Guest"; // Defaults to "Guest" if userInput is falsy
```

---

## ✅ NOT Operator (`!`)

The `NOT (!) operator` **reverses** a boolean value.  
It turns `true` into `false`, and `false` into `true`.

```javascript
// **NOT Operator (!)**
console.log(!true); // false
console.log(!false); // true
```

> **Real-world Example:**  
> Toggling a modal's visibility.

```javascript
let isModalOpen = false;

// Toggle modal state
isModalOpen = !isModalOpen;
console.log(isModalOpen); // true
```

### 🧠 Important Notes:

- `!value` **forces** any value into its boolean opposite.
- `!!value` (double NOT) is a common trick to **force a value into a pure Boolean**.

```javascript
const input = "hello";
console.log(!!input); // true (non-empty strings are truthy)
```

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

### 🔹 `&&` (AND)

- **Meaning:** Logical AND
- **Quick Rule:** ✅ All conditions must be **true**

---

### 🔹 `||` (OR)

- **Meaning:** Logical OR
- **Quick Rule:** ✅ At least **one** condition must be **true**

---

### 🔹 `!` (NOT)

- **Meaning:** Logical NOT
- **Quick Rule:** 🔁 Reverses the **boolean value**

---

- **Short-circuiting** boosts performance: JS stops checking as soon as possible.
- **Truthy/falsy values** are critical for mastering logical operators.
- These operators are **fundamental** for building if-else flows, authentication, error handling, and UI state management.

---

## 🚀 Real-World Tip

In production apps (Node.js APIs, React dashboards, etc.), logical operators are heavily used to:

- Protect routes (`user.isAuthenticated && user.hasSubscription`)
- Simplify conditional rendering (`isLoading || <Loader />`)
- Set default props (`props.title || "Untitled"`)

They’re small, but **mastering them means writing faster, cleaner, and smarter JavaScript**.
