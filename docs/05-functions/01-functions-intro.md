# 📘 Introduction to Functions in JavaScript

Functions are one of the core building blocks in JavaScript—and in programming in general. If you're tired of repeating code and want to write logic that’s reusable, clean, and organized, functions are the way to go.

Let’s break it down step-by-step 👇

## 🔍 What Is a Function?

A **function** is a reusable block of code designed to perform a specific task.

In real-world applications, we often need to execute the same logic multiple times—like validating input, calculating values, or formatting text. Instead of repeating the same code over and over, we wrap it inside a function.

> 🧠 Think of functions as **mini-programs inside your program**—you write them once, and run them as many times as needed.

You've already used functions in JavaScript. Example: `console.log()`—a built-in function that prints output to the browser console.

## ✏️ Function Declaration

You create a function using the `function` keyword. Here's a simple example:

```javascript
// Function that calculates the square of a number
function square(number) {
  return number * number;
}
```

### ✅ Breakdown:

- `function` – Reserved keyword to declare a function.
- `square` – The name of the function. (Can be any valid identifier.)
- `number` – A parameter. It's a placeholder for a value the function will receive.
- `{ return number * number; }` – The function body. It does the actual work.

### 📌 Terminology:

- **Parameter** → Variable listed in function definition (`number`)
- **Argument** → Actual value passed when calling the function (`square(5)`)

## ⚙️ Function Call

Declaring a function doesn’t run it—it just tells JavaScript what to do _when_ it’s called.

```javascript
square(5); // This is a function call
```

The code above calls the `square` function with an argument of `5`. Internally, `number = 5`, so it returns `25`.

## 💾 Using the Return Value

You can also store the returned value in a variable for later use:

```javascript
const result = square(5); // Stores 25 in 'result'
console.log(result); // Logs: 25
```

### ✅ Why store return values?

- Enables further computation.
- Makes your code modular and clean.
- Keeps your logic DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself).

## 🧠 Quick Recap

| Concept            | Description                       |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| `function` keyword | Declares a function               |
| Parameters         | Variables the function expects    |
| Arguments          | Values you pass to the function   |
| `return` statement | Sends a result back to the caller |
| `console.log()`    | Outputs value to the console      |
| Calling a function | Triggers the function logic       |

```javascript
// Example: Full flow
function square(n) {
  return n * n;
}

const result = square(4); // Pass 4 as argument
console.log(result); // Logs: 16
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

- 🧠 **Naming matters**: Use clear, descriptive function names like `calculateTax`, `validateInput`, or `fetchUser`.
- 🔁 **One job only**: Keep functions focused. Follow the **Single Responsibility Principle** (SRP).
- 🎯 **Reusable logic**: Bundle frequently repeated logic into a function to avoid duplication.
- 📈 **Test small pieces**: Functions are easy to unit test—great for TDD or debugging.
