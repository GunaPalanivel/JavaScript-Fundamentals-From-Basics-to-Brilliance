# Introduction to JavaScript Operators

In programming—and especially in JavaScript—**operators** are symbols or keywords that perform operations on values, known as **operands**. Operators are essential for data manipulation, logic building, and control flow. Mastering them is foundational to becoming an effective developer.

## **🔧 Categories of Operators in JavaScript**

JavaScript includes several categories of operators. Here’s a quick overview:

Sure! Here's a cleaner and corrected version of that table using a consistent structure and aligned formatting. This version removes the layout issue in the "Logical" row and improves readability:

### 🔢 JavaScript Operators – Cheat Sheet

| **Category**              | **Example**               | **Description**                                               |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Arithmetic**            | `5 + 3` → `8`             | Performs math operations like addition, subtraction, etc.     |
| **Comparison**            | `5 > 3` → `true`          | Compares two values and returns a Boolean (`true` / `false`)  |
| **Logical**               | `true && false` → `false` | Combines Booleans using AND (`&&`), OR (`WIP`), and NOT (`!`) |
| **Assignment**            | `let x = 5`               | Assigns a value to a variable                                 |
| **Ternary / Conditional** | `(5 > 3) ? 'Yes' : 'No'`  | Shorthand for `if...else`, returns value based on condition   |

# ✏️ Basic Math Operations in JavaScript

Arithmetic operators let you perform fundamental math operations. These are familiar from school—just implemented in code.

## ✅ Supported Arithmetic Operators

| Operator | Description            | Example          | Output |
| -------- | ---------------------- | ---------------- | ------ |
| `+`      | Addition               | `10 + 5`         | `15`   |
| `-`      | Subtraction            | `20 - 7`         | `13`   |
| `*`      | Multiplication         | `6 * 4`          | `24`   |
| `/`      | Division               | `15 / 3`         | `5`    |
| `%`      | Modulus (Remainder)    | `17 % 5`         | `2`    |
| `**`     | Exponentiation (Power) | `3 ** 3`         | `27`   |
| `++`     | Increment (by 1)       | `let x = 5; x++` | `6`    |
| `--`     | Decrement (by 1)       | `let y = 8; y--` | `7`    |
