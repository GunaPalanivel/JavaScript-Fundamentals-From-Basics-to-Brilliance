## 🧠 JavaScript Fundamentals: From Basics to Brilliance

Hey there 👋🏽

This is a **hands-on, no-fluff guide to mastering JavaScript**—built by two passionate developers learning in public. If you're a junior dev or just someone looking to truly understand JavaScript (not just memorize stuff), you’re in the right place.

We’re not just learning this for exams or interviews. We’re learning this to **build real-world stuff, write clean code, and become confident JavaScript developers**—the kind that don’t Google `how to reverse an array` every time 😅

**📘 For the full deep dive, check out [`javascript.md`](./javascript.md)**

### 🔥 Why We Made This

We (me and my friend) realized that a lot of beginner tutorials online either rush through concepts or don’t explain _why_ things work. So we decided to build our own learning system:

- Each concept lives in its own folder (like `01-introduction`, `02-variables-and-data-types`, `03-operators-and-equality`, etc.)
- Each folder has clear explanations, code, comments, and real-world examples
- We treat this like our own internal bootcamp—only public, so _you_ can learn with us

## 🧮 [Variables and Data Types](./02-variables-and-data-types/README.md)

In this module, we’ll nail down the basics that everything else builds on:

- Comments & Variable Declarations
- Primitive Types: String, Number, Boolean, Null, Undefined
- Objects in JS
- Statically vs Dynamically Typed Languages
- Interview Prep: Variables & Types

---

## ➕ [Operators and Equality](./03-operators-and-equality/README.md)

Here’s where we dive into how JS evaluates, compares, and manipulates data:

- Arithmetic Operators
- Comparison Operators and Equality
- Strict (===) vs Loose (==) Equality
- Logical Operators (&&, ||, !)
- Assignment Operators

---

## 🔁 [Logic and Control Flow](./04-logic-and-control-flow/README.md)

JS is all about decisions and loops. This section walks through:

- If/Else Statements
- Truthy & Falsy Values
- Logical Operators Continued
- Switch Case
- Ternary Operator
- Loops (for, while)

---

## 🧩 [Functions](./05-functions/README.md)

Functions are the real building blocks. This section covers everything from basics to best practices:

- Declaring & Invoking Functions
- Return Values
- Arrow Functions
- Parameters vs Arguments
- Naming Best Practices

---

## 📝 [Strings in Detail](./06-strings-in-detail/README.md)

Time to level up your string game:

- String Properties & Length
- Case Conversion
- Substring Search & Extraction
- Split, Reverse, Repeat, Trim
- Hands-on Practice

---

## 📦 [Arrays in Detail](./07-arrays-in-detail/README.md)

Everything from loops to high-order methods — arrays are where it gets powerful:

- Array Methods Overview
- forEach, map, filter, find, includes
- some, every, sort, reduce

---

## 🔑 [Objects in Detail](./08-objects-in-detail/README.md)

We go deep into how to work with key-value pairs like a pro:

- Accessing & Updating Props
- Object Methods
- Built-in Object Methods

---

## 🧠 [Tricky Concepts (Scope, Closures, etc.)](./09-tricky-concepts/README.md)

These concepts are where JS really starts flexing. You’ll finally _get_ closures and hoisting:

- Scope in JavaScript
- Hoisting
- Closures
- Practical Exercises

---

## 🧪 [Value vs. Reference](./09-tricky-concepts/README.md)

We’ll break down the difference between primitive vs reference types:

- Deep Cloning

---

---

## ⏳ [Asynchronous JavaScript](./13-async-js/README.md)

---

## 🛠️ [Next Steps (Frontend + Backend)](./16-next-steps/README.md)

Once you've got your JavaScript basics sorted, here’s where to go next:

- Frontend Frameworks: React, Vue, Angular, Astro, Svelte
- Backend: Node.js, Express, APIs, DBs

---

### ⚠️ Common Mistakes We’ll Help You Avoid

- Using `var` in 2025 😅
- Misunderstanding `this` inside arrow functions
- Forgetting that `==` does type coercion
- Not realizing `const` doesn’t make objects immutable
- Writing nested if-else when a switch or map could do better
