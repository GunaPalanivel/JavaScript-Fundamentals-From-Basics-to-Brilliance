## 🧠 JavaScript Fundamentals: From Basics to Brilliance

Hey there 👋🏽

This is a **hands-on, no-fluff guide to mastering JavaScript**—built by two passionate developers learning in public. If you're a junior dev or just someone looking to truly understand JavaScript (not just memorize stuff), you’re in the right place.

We’re not just learning this for exams or interviews. We’re learning this to **build real-world stuff, write clean code, and become confident JavaScript developers**—the kind that don’t Google `how to reverse an array` every time 😅

**📘 For the full deep dive, check out [`javaScript.md`](./javaScript.md)**

### 🔥 Why We Made This

We (me and my friend) realized that a lot of beginner tutorials online either rush through concepts or don’t explain _why_ things work. So we decided to build our own learning system:

- Each concept lives in its own folder (like `01-introduction`, `02-variables-and-data-types`, `03-operators-and-equality`, etc.)
- Each folder has clear explanations, code, comments, and real-world examples
- We treat this like our own internal bootcamp—only public, so _you_ can learn with us

- [Assignment Operators](./03-operators-and-equality/06-assignment-operators.md)

---

## 🔁 [Logic and Control Flow](./04-logic-and-control-flow/README.md)

JS is all about decisions and loops. This section walks through:

### ⚠️ Common Mistakes We’ll Help You Avoid

- Using `var` in 2025 😅
- Misunderstanding `this` inside arrow functions
- Forgetting that `==` does type coercion
- Not realizing `const` doesn’t make objects immutable
- Writing nested if-else when a switch or map could do better
